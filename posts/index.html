				If you know me, you know I'm a Star Wars buff. I grew up reading novels about Jedi padawans learning to use the force.
A key Jedi practice is meditation. By relaxing their minds, the Jedi would connect with 'the Force'.
But this isn't a total fantasy. George Lucas was inspired by many real-world references when creating Star Wars, including the meditation practices of Tibetan monks.

			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				For myself, I've come to realize that my interests have led me to be a psychonaut:
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				Psychonautics (from the Ancient Greek ψυχή psychē "soul, spirit, mind" and ναύτης naútēs "sailor, navigator" – "a sailor of the soul") refers both to a methodology for describing and explaining the subjective effects of altered states of consciousness.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				The evidence being, I actively explore altered states of consciousness through virtual reality, meditation, and lucid dreaming. With my background in software engineering for the purpose of virtual reality, understanding first-hand what it means to EXPERIENCE is fundamental to my work.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				In exploring the mind, I have discovered something that many people have already known – rather more in Asia but also in a minority across the world – which mainstream society has yet to realize.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				For instance, when Googling 'meditation', this mainstream definition surfaces:
				<br>
				"Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state."
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				The goal of countless videos, seminars, apps, and books on meditation is to "reduce stress", "calm the mind", "relax", etc. – all concerns a paramedic might present as a cure for a stressed-out society. As though it's just something to do to stay healthy.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				But it's so much more. I have discovered that the mainstream definition just barely brushes the surface. Consider meditation as an ocean to swim in. Having been diving into the practice for several years now, I have barely explored the depths, yet I have discovered that those touted reasons to meditate are merely the initial byproducts of the activity; transitioning to a calm mind is level 0, the starting point. If you swim deeper, there are all kinds of bioluminescent plants and new species of experience to discover.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				Yes, you can meditate simply to reduce stress and find your emotional center. But that's like going to a swimming pool and dipping your toes in the water just enough to feel the temperature. You're only sensing a touch of what meditation has to offer.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				In discovering the philosopher Alan Watts, who eloquently speaks about eastern wisdom in a way that reconciles it with his western upbringing, I gained an appreciation for the deeper practice of meditation. Here is an excellent, relevant recording by this Mr. Rodgers of the mind:
				<br>
				https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pcLuwxhhkk
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				Meditation isn't just about quieting your mind, and certainly isn't about putting all your effort into focusing on breathing and trying very hard to concentrate. This is often overplayed in the Star Wars movies, with characters like Rey and Yoda himself creasing their brow in concentration, even gritting their teeth.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				What happens when you quiet the chatter in your mind is not the discovery of a mental vacuum – far from it. It's by quieting your mental space that raw, pre-language reality begins to pour in, and the thought-words normally flitting through your consciousness begin to drift by casually instead of steering the ship of your senses.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				As Sam Harris puts it, everyday consciousness with mental chatter is like stargazing with light pollution. You never know what you're missing until you seek out a viewing area far from the bright and distracting human constructs that obscure your vision. (lit cityscapes, in other words, are like the words that keep popping in your head).
But you may catch glimpses of innate consciousness now and then: a flying lucid dream during the night, a precognitive visual image as you wake up.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				If we are really interested in being scientific, we approach this reality with an open mind: How is this possible? What is a flying lucid dream? Why do we catch glimpses of the future?
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				I get it – stargazing with light pollution is boring. But it also obscures our understanding of reality. It's like Plato's allegory of the cave; the entire world appears materialistic when that's all you can see.
Meditation is *really* about what happens when you begin to resonate directly with your senses, as opposed to listening to your thoughts. It's literally about connecting with the FORCE around you, allowing it to pour into your awareness so you may experience it clearly. In practice, meditation feels like diving into an experience of transformative awe that leaves the mind yearning for further exploration.
			</p>
			<p class="wow fadeIn">
				I've by no means seen it all (thankfully). But I've seen enough, now, to know that the force is real. All of it.
				<br>
				More to come.
