						<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/512750" target="blank" style="font-weight: bold">One Giant Leap</a> is a Windows game for the <a href="https://www.htcvive.com/us/" target="blank">Vive</a>, developed in <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="blank">Unity</a> with C# and the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr" target="blank">'SteamVR' plugin</a>, and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/512750" target="blank">available on Steam</a>. I've always been inspired by innovative games like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=battlezone+2&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-murvsMzOAhVFKh4KHQv4DBcQ_AUICSgC&biw=1745&bih=868" target="blank">Battlezone</a> and <a href="http://www.tribesascend.com/" target="blank">Tribes Ascend</a> for their <span style="font-weight: bold">immersive space environments</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">joy of maneuverability</span>, so naturally that's the kind of experience I set out to make on the Vive.
						<br>
						<br>
						In One Giant Leap you are equipped with a pair of <span style="font-weight: bold">booster jets</span> for controllers! Simply thrust <span style="font-style: italic">downward</span>, and feel yourself launched <span style="font-style: italic">upward;</span> or aim your jets <span style="font-style: italic">behind,</span> and be propelled <span style="font-style: italic">ahead!</span> This is the first half of my goal – exploring a locomotion mechanic new to the Vive scene, but that I've enjoyed in similar forms in the past and that I dream of using in real life. With this method of motion, you may smoothly complete missions on the moon, as well as explore the stunning lunar terrain in free flight. You have an <span style="font-weight: bold">open-moon environment</span> at your controller-tips!
						<br>
						<br>
						The game is available through <span style="font-weight: bold">Steam Early Access</span>, meaning it is still a work in progress. It's already playable, though – and I'm selling it for less during Early Access to encourage players to provide valuable feedback.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span style="font-weight: bold">Now available for playtesting!</span>

						<span style="font-weight: bold">Run a Ton</span> <span style="font-style: italic">(and shoot some guns!)</span> is a scrolling, procedurally generated, pseudo- <span style="font-style: italic">endless runner</span> platformer game, developed for Android devices. The player leads a sword-wielding heroine across the plains of her <span style="font-weight: bold">fantasy world</span> to fend off <span style="font-weight: bold">evil robots</span> invading from another dimension. The goal is to reach the portal at the other end of the world, warp through it, and eliminate the source of the robots. Along the way the player can collect valuable <span style="font-weight: bold">gold coins</span>, equip loot like <span style="font-weight: bold">laserguns, ammo clips, armor, and more</span>, grab various <span style="font-weight: bold">powerups</span> such as disguises, defeat <span style="font-weight: bold">multiple different enemy types with unique behaviors</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">purchase items at stores</span> that they pass by, all in the attempt to get <span style="font-weight: bold">as far as possible</span> and perhaps even <span style="font-weight: bold">complete the objective <span style="font-style: italic">(a remarkable accomplishment)!</span></span>
						<br>
						<br>
						Developing the game served as a fantastic introduction to <span style="font-weight: bold">Android development in <a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="blank">Unity</a> using C#</span>, and of course, <a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.hoosiergames.org/" target="blank">the Hoosier Games studio</a>! As the lead programmer, I got to work with a team led by designer <span style="font-weight: bold">Josh Smith</span>, along with senior programmer <span style="font-weight: bold">Drake Rozenboom</span> and skilled artist <span style="font-weight: bold">Jay Humphrey</span>. We met version control challenges with <a href="https://github.com/" target="blank">Git Hub</a> and managed the project via <a href="https://slack.com/" target="blank">Slack</a> and <a href="https://asana.com/" target="blank">Asana</a>. Every few weeks we presented our progress to others in Hoosier Games. The final product was a playable game on Android.

						<a href="https://github.com/Hunter-Bobeck/Flash_Mob" target="blank" style="font-weight: bold">Flash Mob</a> is a procedural text adventure game. <span style="font-weight: bold">Each time you play, a new adventure is generated!</span> The main focus of the game is to continuously explore, defeat "mobs" (monsters and other baddies) you encounter in combat along the way, and gain experience with which to train yourself new abilities. Flash Mob's style of interaction with the user is derived from my experience playing various "MUD" games online. The setting for the game is inspired by <span style="font-style: italic">the Forgotten Realms</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Warcraft</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">The Lord of the Rings</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">The Elder Scrolls</span>, and similar fantasies. I've written the game in Java, and I incorporate a lot of randomization, procedural generation, and creative description to make the different environments, encounters, mobs, and everything else entertaining!

						During elementary and middle school I played <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">Warcraft III'</span>s campaigns and multiplayer games</span>. I had most of my fun playing and designing <span style="font-weight: bold">custom game mods</span> with others. The game is still a massive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90H-ARdf1dw" target="blank">nostalgia trip</a> for me.
						<br>
						<br>
						Mods I made include various <span style="font-weight: bold">"tug-of-war"</span> maps, <span style="font-weight: bold">roleplaying adventure episodes</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">swordfighter and wizard dueling maps</span>, and crossover content such as <span style="font-weight: bold">flying spaceships, fighting with lighstabers, and using the force</span>. I also had a creative time making <span style="font-weight: bold">cinematic exchanges with preexisting unit dialogue</span>. Here is an example.. <a style="font-weight: bold" href="https://vid.me/mlIT" target="blank">Troll Tribes - Selling Smokes</a>.
						<br>
						<br>
						My greatest single creation was a massive addon to the "melee" game mode... I called it <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Warcraft IV: Evolution</span>, supplementing the original four races <span style="font-style: italic">(human, undead, orc, night elf)</span> with <span style="font-weight: bold">8 more</span> based on other creature factions present in the lore: <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">dwarves, goblins, fel orcs, dranei, demons, naga, gnolls, and dark elves & satyrs;</span> <a style="font-weight: bold" href="https://gfycat.com/AnxiousDirectCougar" target="blank">here is what the Race Selection Dialog looked like.</a> Each new race meant custom units, structures, abilities, and tech trees that I designed, resulting in unique playstyles being introduced to the game and also the task of balancing the powers of each race for fair gameplay. I worked with other modders from sites such as the wonderful <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/" target="blank">Hive Workshop</a> to incorporate art and sound assets others they created. The best part about creating customs such as these was the <span style="font-weight: bold">enjoyment of being a game developer – gratification in seeing a compelling game with cool custom features come together</span>. I largely attribute my experiences with this game to what I do today.
