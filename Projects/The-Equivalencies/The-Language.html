		<h1>The Language</h1>
		<div class="text">
			<p>
				The Equivalencies are necessarily philosophically precise, such that the regular English language is often inadequate. Sometimes I find the grammar and formatting of conventional English to be nonsensical and archaic, so I make changes to the language as I see fit. Usually the changes are for purposes of clarity and precision, other times they are additions that seem necessary to accurately describe my thoughts in a simple manner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since language is necessarily discrete, based on specific letters, words, etc., it is ironic that to write out my philosophy I must use symbols whose meaning assume individuality, when ultimately I understand that everything is equivalent, continuous, in unity. Describing the universe, a process of shaping meaning to best match the way things are, is with typed language about as close to a pure conveyance of philosophical understanding as any method of communication can be with modern technology. And in order to unlearn contrives, it is necessary to use lesser contrives to discuss them. However, what I do my best to stray away from is actually inventing, as in creating ideas, to develop any understanding of the universe; that is necessarily inaccurate, since the universe is not created. So while 'conceptualizing the equivalencies as the nature of the universe' is by essence an artifice, I intend to interpret without the bias of what I might make up or wish to prove, and instead focus on unlearning contrives, realizing the most precise understandings instead.

				Quotation Precision
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				Quotation marks, by imprecise academic convention, are supposed to go after any unincluded (original sentence) punctuation, like so..
			</p>
			<p class="doubletabbed content">
				There was a cow that said “moo.”
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				That is totally illogical; <span class="content">the period</span> has nothing to do with <span class="content">the cow's statement</span>. It could have, if it were <span class="content">a sentence from the cow</span>, but it wasn't. Regardless, there should be a period after the closing quotation mark since the sentence needs punctuation. It shouldn't matter how ugly it would look if there were two periods in close proximity; ugly precision should come before glossed-up confusion. It should really look like one of these two examples (where the second example demonstrates the cow actually saying a sentence instead of just a phrase):
			</p>
			<ul class="doubletabbed content">
				<li>There was a cow that said “moo”.</li>
				<li>There was a cow that said “Moo.”.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p class="tabbed">
				All programmers experience firsthand the importance of being precise. We define the boundaries of "strings" (text variables) by typing surrounding quotations, and never include any exterior components of the line of code within the quotations. For example..
			</p>
			<p class="doubletabbed content">
				String hello_world = "Hello world!";
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				That's how I declare text variables in Java, the language <a href="../Flash-Mob/index.html" target="blank">Flash Mob</a> is written in. This isn't just true of Java, though. In fact, <span class="italic">the paragraph above</span> is encoded in 'HTML5' as the following..
			</p>
			<pre class="content">					&lt;p class="doubletabbed content">
							String hello_world = "Hello world!";
						&lt;/p></pre>
			<p class="tabbed">
				The interpretation would be very different if, say, the '<span class="content">></span>' denoting <span class="content">the end of the opening tag of the paragraph element</span> ('<span class="content">&lt;p class="doubletabbed content"<span class="regularly-underlined">></span></span>') was moved one place to the left, like so..
			</p>
			<pre class="content">					&lt;p class="doubletabbed content>"<span class="regular" style="font-size: 30px"> ↲</span>
							String hello_world = "Hello world!";
						&lt;/p></pre>
			<p class="tabbed">
				See the result below – oh wait, it doesn't even display as anything other than some slight line spacing, even though in the code, it's right below this paragraph!
			</p>
			<p class="doubletabbed content>"
				String hello_world = "Hello world!", goodbye_world = "Goodbye world!";
			</p>

			<p id="Quotation-Types" class="bold">
				Quotation Types
			</p>
			<ul class="tabbed">
				<li>
					<span class="regular">•</span> <span class="content">Double quotation marks</span> signify a quoted statement or a claim being referred to.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="regular">•</span> <span class="content">Single quotation marks</span> either <span class="italic content">objectify or introduce a phrase</span> or <span class="italic content">introduce a word</span>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p id="Sniglets" class="bold">
				<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CEsQtwIwBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTixwF_ywN4A&ei=JS6EVYKSDZLEogS5sYCwBw&usg=AFQjCNHGJVJjsVRt0SN3M42bjMcnW1NxOA&sig2=KMy0mCv35RDhRRF821biJg">Sniglets</a>
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				I've added new words as I've felt the need for them in order to express myself simply. For example, '<span class="content">apparance</span>' (a noun): '<span class="content">something that is apparent</span>' (its usage is unique from '<span class="content">appearance</span>' because its meaning is not slanted toward <span class="content">the sense of vision</span>).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="Phrase-Wordifications" class="bold">
				Phrase Wordifications
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				Many common phrases have been wordified, to be clear about their usage as words with their common meaning rather than phrases to be literally read. For example, the phrase '<span class="content">in fact</span>' is often used to mention something of a related note, perhaps to further prove a point. I'd rather stray away from implying I'm focused on an issue of true or false, of facts and falsehoods, so I've often wordified the phrase into '<span class="content">infact</span>' to show I simply mean the colloquialized meaning behind the phrase. Another example is 'of course' being written as 'ofcourse'. It's just a little more confusing to think of it as two words, since we always interpret it as a saying altogether, not interpreting the meaning per word.
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">versa</span>' is used instead of '<span class="content">vice versa</span>' simply because the phrase has been used enough to warrant being a word, and to do so I figure just leaving off the '<span class="content">vice</span>' is best as it is not unique (already being another word all to itself).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="Continuations" class="bold">
				Continuations
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">:</span>' denotes a following <span class="italic">list</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">..</span>' denotes a following <span class="italic">item</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">...</span>' denotes a following <span class="italic">statement</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">-</span>' denotes a following <span class="italic">subitem</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">–</span>' denotes a following <span class="italic">interjection</span>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="Slashes-and-Division" class="bold">
				Slashes and Division
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="content">/</span>' means <span class="content">'or', in an implied sense</span>, while '<span class="content">\</span>' means <span class="content">'or' (not in an implied sense, but simply an 'either' sense)</span>; '<span class="content">/</span>' doesn't mean <span class="content">division</span>, '<span class="content">÷</span>' does.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="Surprise-Marks" class="bold">
				Surprise Marks
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				The sentence punctuation '<span class="content">!!</span>' denotes a specific kind of excitement – surprise.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p id="Italics" class="bold">
				Italics
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				'<span class="italic content">Italics</span>' signify either <span class="content"><span class="italic">parallel aspects being meant in accordance with one another</span> or <span class="italic">just simple emphasis</span></span>, like so.
