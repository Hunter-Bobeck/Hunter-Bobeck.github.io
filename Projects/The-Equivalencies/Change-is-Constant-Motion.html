		<h1>Change is Constant Motion</h1>
		<p class="text-centered content">
			“Everything changes and nothing stands still.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="italic regular">~ Heraclitus</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			Everything is always in flux. The only constant is change, and the only change is constant. Constancy and change are distinguishable interpretations derived from distinguishable perspectives, each perspective observing the same subject; the two concepts, together, are merely two sides of the same token. They are an equivalency. All things change, constantly, and the only thing unchanging is change. Such a paradox is only evidence of the binary confusion between change and constancy, revealing the truth of their unity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nothing in reality is truly static; only the abstract thought of change is constant. Everything is always moving because motion is relative and each aspect of the universe is relative to every other. So even if something seems still, it is also moving relative to something else. Even from the absolute precision of the holistic perspective, considering the universe as the whole it is, the universe still moves within itself relative to itself. Just, among its infinite vastness, any amount of motion is at the same time insignificant.
		</p>
		<p>
			Change is fundamentally necessary to existence. Without difference, relativity is impossible, and thus inexperienceable. Yet we do experience, due to the constant change of reality.

Because we only notice movement/change, our senses are feeds to consciousness of change itself, of motion in the <a href="The-Fractal-Wave-Universe.html" target="blank">waveforms of the universe</a>. <a href="Awareness-from-Your-Senses.html" target="blank">Our senses are our experience and reality.</a>
