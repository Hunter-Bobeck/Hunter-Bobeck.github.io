    <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered where the universe came from, what it's made of, how it works, what the meaning of life is, or what you will experience when you die? The Equivalences is a philosophy of reasoning at the extremes, unlearning contrives, and holistic understanding that seeks to answer these questions and more by unlocking the secrets of infinity and reevaluating assumptions made by mainstream science, language, and spirituality.">		<!-- description (shown on searchengine result) -->

				I'm always thinking about the universe. <a href="../../index.html#profile" target="blank">As a gamer at heart</a>, I like to know more about my world, how its elements interact, who I am, and how my experience is going to change. <span class="bold">The Equivalencies</span> is my philosophy, and I'm always writing more, hypothesizing about the nature of reality as best as I can figure. Sometimes I have extensive <a href="images/Swiping.gif" target="blank">swiping</a> sessions on my phone, where I furiously get all of my thoughts down in text form before I lose them... because oftentimes thinking one thought leads to thinking many others, mostly more questions. It's all very fun. It's essentially about finding patterns in the consciousness, physics, forms, and other manifestations of the universe. It's also about unlearning contradictory assumptions society as a whole has made about existence, such as discretion. Most importantly, it's about reaching further understanding of one's situation, and determining meaning for oneself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Among the pages of The Equivalencies, I primarily discuss how so many things are equivalent, and the insights that come from evaluating related perspectives. You will find links everywhere. I do a lot of connection and a lot of sharing. It wouldn't have worked out well if I had just left each page individual, or else I would be reexplaining myself all too frequently. Each of these topics is connected; ofcourse, continuity between discrete ideas is a common theme of my philosophy. Plus, I hope you will find a lot of the references and works of others I share to be as insightful as I have.
