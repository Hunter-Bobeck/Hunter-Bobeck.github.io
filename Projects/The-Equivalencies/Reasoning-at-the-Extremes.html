		<h1>Reasoning at the Extremes</h1>
		<p>
			We define rules that describe the universe. If they are accurate, philosophically precise descriptions of reality, then they hold up in all cases. Otherwise, they are limited to the approximating realm our minds imagine.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws" target="blank">Clarke's Second Law</a> wisely reads as follows..
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed content">
			"The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible."
		</p>
		<p>
			In exactly the same way, one can determine whether a definition's logic holds up universally by testing whether it works at the extremes, in the reality that <a href="The-indiscrete-Numbers,-the-Fundamental-Equivalencies.html" target="blank">the indiscrete numbers</a> represent, as opposed to only working in <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">the discrete realm the mind imagines</a>. Thus, I often symbolize the extremes of a situation through the indiscrete numbers: <span class="content">0</span>, <span class="content">1</span>, and <span class="content">∞</span>, the symbols for extremity of value.
		</p>
		<p>
			Want an example? Einstein <a href="http://www.adamauton.com/warp/emc2.html" target="blank">derived his famous equation</a> by reasoning at the extremes: <span class="content">photons exhibit no mass, yet the maximum theoretical velocity (the speed of light)</span>; furthermore, he imagined his thought experiment within a <span class="content">deep space</span> scene, implying <span class="content">practically no gravity or other external forces involved</span>. Such controls tend to take the form of <span class="content">0</span> and <span class="content">1</span> extremes: nonexistences (such as <span class="content">no gravity</span>) and universals (such as <span class="content">continuous lack of gravity</span>), respectively. A <span class="content">photon</span> was excellent to do a logical thought experiment about, since its extremes exposed the hole in the fallacious assumption that <span class="content">"momentum is dependent only on mass"</span>. By thinking metacognitively, he reevaluated this assumption, realizing that <span class="content">momentum is really dependent on both mass and energy</span>. This he demonstrated by showing that <span class="content">mass and energy are proportionally equivalent</span>, factoring in <span class="content">the speed of light</span> as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			What makes the extremes in any context so important is that they will reveal, through <span class="bold">metacognitive reasoning</span> resulting from logical thought experimentation and other methods, whether the foundations of a system of logic hold up in all cases or if they break down and fail, to be proven nonuniversally applicable.
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			Infact, as part of my philosophy, I have discovered that <span class="italic">even our basis of logic itself is imperfect</span>, for it is a contrivance for human convenience. However, this means it is still tremendously useful for the conveyance of other (necessarily discrete and human) thoughts, such as those followed in <a href="Unlearning-Contrives.html" target="blank">unlearning imprecise understandings</a>. Just, I will usually be explaining how false assumptions lead to contrivance and confusion. You will find that understanding the philosophy of The Equivalencies is more a process of <span class="italic">unlearning</span> than one of <span class="italic">teaching</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is most helpful to evaluate reasoning at the extremes, because my philosophy primarily deals with metaphysical-type questions. This is due to the 'meta' component of the word 'metaphysics' – the aspect of looking at the context of the subject instead. So metaphysics, as a philosophy for understanding the context of the science of physics, relates to dealing with and comprehending scopes, levels, derivatives, or other terms for thinking about the subject by looking beyond its direct evaluation. By the meta manner of understanding, the way in which evaluating reasoning at the extremes is helpful is that it allows reasoning to go beyond the immediate scope of the subject, while still staying relevant; by considering the extremes of a subject, you can find the continuity between that subject and others. This continuity is critical because the whole universe is continuous, and understanding must be consistent.
