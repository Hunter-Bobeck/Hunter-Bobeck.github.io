		<h1>Equivalency Holes in Mathematics</h1>
		<p>
			<span class="bold">Mathematics</span> is our set of concepts derivative of the idea of <span class="bold">count</span>, which relies on the assumption of <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank" class="bold">discretion</a>. It is an excellent model that ranges from merely basic ideas to extremely complex applications. It's also very old, which in itself isn't so much wrong as it is a warning. An accurate warning, as it turns out, for you find that <a href="Unlearning-Contrives.html" target="blank">mathematics is archaically unintuitive at higher levels</a>. Besides that more specific issue, though, <span class="bold">it has a few philosophical holes</span>, too. Three, to be exact. <a href="The-Indiscrete-Numbers,-the-Fundamental-Equivalencies.html" target="blank">The three symbols of indiscretion</a>, which naturally go against the <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">assumption of discretion</a> mathematics relies on.
		</p>
		<p>
			In noticing difference/<a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">discretion</a>, we frequently <a href="http://marctenbosch.com/news/2014/07/consistency-boundary-what-makes-a-logically-and-mathematically-consistent-system/" target="blank">define boundaries in order to construct models of understanding (and only later end up finding the inevitable holes in our models)</a>. Seeing as mathematics is such a fundamental expression of our understanding of measurable things in the universe, these holes are serious red flags in the foundation of any philosophy assuming count to be real.
		</p>
		<p>
			So how are these holes such? Well, the <a href="Reasoning-at-the-Extremes.html" target="blank">extremes</a> are where mathematics breaks down. Wherever you see <a href="The-Indiscrete-Numbers,-the-Fundamental-Equivalencies.html" target="blank">the indiscrete numbers</a> of <span class="content">0</span>, <span class="content">1</span>, and <span class="content">∞</span>, mathematics tends to fail.
		</p>
		<p>
			For starters, division by zero is infamously called <span class="content">“undefined”</span>. This is the convention mathematics ostracizes infinity by; really, with the utmost precision, dividing anything <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">discrete</a> by zero would have to be considered infinite since you can fit infinite zeroes into any other value. But infinity isn't considered a number by the conventions of mathematics because its value isn't <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">discrete</a>. So in having no definite answer, it has been called <span class="content">“undefined”</span>. <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">Discretion</a> is both the defining rule of mathematics and the culprit of its contrivance…
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the terms considered <span class="content">“undefined”</span> is the fraction <span class="content"><span class="superscript">0</span>&frasl;<span class="subscript">0</span></span>. This one is even more troublesome, though, more precisely receiving the title <span class="content">“indeterminate”</span>. This is because you could also say any of the following:
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			<span class="content">0</span>, because any fraction with a numerator of zero would be zero fractions
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			<span class="content">1</span>, because when any number is divided by itself, the totality is a whole
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			<span class="content">∞</span>, because division of anything into pieces of size zero results in infinite pieces
		</p>
		<p>
			And so, the answer is considered <span class="content">“indeterminate”</span> – there's no reason to choose one of these answers as being more correct. Although, philosophically, a slightly more precise understanding would be that each is correct, just depending on the perspective you consider it from. The perspectives are really equivalent.
		</p>
		<p>
			In defense of the philosophical precision of mathematics, someone is going to argue that these are not shortcomings. But is it not apparent that when your system of logic, especially <span class="bold">one focused on finding <span class="italic">solutions</span></span>, must be patched with such <span class="italic">indecisions</span> as undefinability and indeterminance that it is flawed on a universal level? Should not a system of logic be universally applicable, or else be imperfect by being occasionally false? Indeed, in realizing its flaws and giving them titles you can pretend that the system is fixed. However, a perfect understanding would not need fixing. It's really that simple.
		</p>
		<p>
			A related way in which extremes expose holes in mathematics is through an equation with <a href="The-Indiscrete-Numbers,-the-Fundamental-Equivalencies.html" target="blank">the indiscrete numbers</a>:
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			First, take the three forms of this equation:
		</p>
		<p class="doubletabbed content">
			<span class="superscript">1</span>&frasl;<span class="subscript">0</span> = ∞
		</p>
		<p class="doubletabbed content">
			∞0 = 1
		</p>
		<p class="doubletabbed content">
			<span class="superscript">1</span>&frasl;<span class="subscript">∞</span> = 0
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			Then, compare those to the three forms of a similar equation, where you replace <span class="content">1</span> with another number, say <span class="content">7</span>:
		</p>
		<p class="doubletabbed content">
			<span class="superscript">7</span>&frasl;<span class="subscript">0</span> = ∞
		</p>
		<p class="doubletabbed content">
			∞0 = 7
		</p>
		<p class="doubletabbed content">
			<span class="superscript">7</span>&frasl;<span class="subscript">∞</span> = 0
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			What is demonstrated is that holistically, there is an indeterminate solution. For example, what is the simplification of <span class="content">∞0</span>? Is it <span class="content">1</span> or is it <span class="content">7</span>? Now, by the conventional rules, these kinds of equations aren't even allowed in the first place. Over time, this inconsistency has been prevented simply by disallowing infinity from being used – that's why it's not considered a number. But what this shows is that there is a hole in mathematics that had to be patched; a universally applicable system of logic would not have any exceptions! One would not be equivalent to every number, nor any number equivalent to any other, if mathematics was totally philosophically sound.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/37327/infinity-1-paradox" target="blank">There are other counterexamples to mathematics too</a>, with the only explanation always being ~<span class="content">"this isn't allowed"</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's another demonstration that is even simpler..
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed content">
			∞ + 1 = ∞
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed content">
			1 = 0
		</p>
		<p>
			That <span class="content">1</span> could be any other number and you would still be equaling your number to zero.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most mathematicians brush these counterexamples aside, with the only argument being that such is unallowed/invalid/wrong because infinity is not a number. But that is just an exclusive label slapped on as an excuse in order to keep up the gamelike model of mathematics. And the ironic truth is that infinity, along with the other <a href="The-Indiscrete-Numbers,-the-Fundamental-Equivalencies.html" target="blank">indiscrete numbers</a>, is one of the best possible symbols for describing the universe.
		</p>
		<p>
			In tandem with the realization that unpatched mathematics implies equivalency of all numbers, we find that for what they're worth, <a href="The-Indiscrete-Numbers,-the-Fundamental-Equivalencies.html" target="blank">the indiscrete numbers</a> are more valid philosophically because they can more fairly and equivalently describe the universe and its aspects. This is surely due to their lacking assumption of discretion. Their equivalency reveals truth through the facility of <a href="Reasoning-at-the-Extremes.html" target="blank">reasoning at the extremes</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having trouble accepting that zero and infinity are equivalent? Zero is more similar to infinity than you might realize, because <a href="Zero-Equals-Infinitesimality.html" target="blank">it's the same thing as infinitesimality</a>, which is the inverse of infinity! Zero is the inverse of infinity in the simplest sense just because <span class="content">1/∞</span> (or anything over infinity) equals zero. From there, it's just a matter of perspective. You can say zero is infinite smallness. You can say infinity is zero smallness! Each way, all you're saying is that each one is the other in the opposite direction. And direction is ambiguous until perspective is applied! Zero and infinity are philosophically equivalent because only perspective differentiates them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="content">One</span>, too, is equivalent to the other indiscrete numbers by the following reasonings:
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			<span class="content">0</span> - nothingness, if you are assuming such can be perceived to exist (<a href="Unreasoning-the-Existence-and-Creation-of-the-Universe.html" target="blank">which philosophically precisely it cannot</a>), is able to be seen as a <span class="bold">whole</span>; it is not bounded by the identified lines of existence and as such it is continuous
		</p>
		<p class="tabbed">
			<span class="content">∞</span> - infinity necessarily goes beyond any defined boundaries infinitely, breaking all bounds and thus encompassing the <span class="bold">whole</span> universe
		</p>
		<p>
			The indiscrete numbers are the most relevant to philosophical understanding. There is a contrived reliance on discrete quantities alone, leading infinity to be ostracized behind layers of compounded reasoning, archaic enough that we accept them widely in culture as philosophical truth. That's what I'm focusing on unlearning. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nothing-that-Is-Natural/dp/0195142373" target="blank">As for zero, it took a long time for its concept to be invented.</a> The number one is very popular, though, simply because it's critical to mathematics as the base unit of count by which all other values are relative.
		</p>
		<p>
			I noticed these holes thanks to the insightful power of <a href="Reasoning-at-the-Extremes.html" target="blank">reasoning at the extremes</a>. What you realize is that if mathematics' logic dealing with values doesn't apply to the fullest extent of value, the infinite extreme, then the logical system is ultimately flawed. And certainly, if any numbers were totally real and not just concepts in our heads, the most real numbers would be the extremes – the universe is best described in terms of value as either <span class="italic">derivative of nothing</span> \<span class="italic">valueless</span> (<span class="content">0</span>), <span class="italic">singular</span> (<span class="content">1</span>), or <span class="italic">infinite</span> (<span class="content">∞</span>), not as a sum of individual parts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Admittedly, without discrete values, there's no use for mathematics. That's why, interestingly, we can use these systems of fundamental falsehoods, like discretion, value, and mathematics, to solve problems with powerful applications. Say, getting a spaceship to the moon! What I'm saying is the power of approximation is considerable, it just depends on how far you take it. There are other realms in which mathematics bears less fruit, though. For example, in predicting weather. Predictions cannot be made too far out, or else due to statistics the inaccuracies will compound and lead to significant error. This is because there are infinite variables to deal with in the prediction of weather in the reality of the universe. Only in a virtual realm can predictions be certain, perfectly precisely accurate. <Span class="bold"><a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">Discretion is inherently an approximation</a> because the universe is inherently indiscrete – in order to describe that which is indiscrete by mathematics, you would need infinite (inherently discrete) equations, which isn't discretely possible!</Span> The closest thing you've got in mathematics are its symbols of indiscrete numbers. Those are like equations all to themselves!
