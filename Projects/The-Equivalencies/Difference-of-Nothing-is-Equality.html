		<h1>Difference of Nothing is Equality</h1>
		<br>
		<div class="text">
			<p>
				If something changes by an amount of <span class="bold">zero</span>, is it philosophically the <span class="bold">same</span>? Ofcourse!
			</p>
			<p>
				It's time for a thought experiment. You've got <span class="content">a jar</span>, and you've got <span class="content">marbles</span>. You can <span class="content">put marbles in the jar</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now say we <span class="bold content">add nothing to the jar</span>, then two descriptions apply that normally would be mutually exclusive; a binary is broken down:
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed content">
				<span class="regular">•</span> The total number of marbles in the jar changes – by nothing.
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed content">
				<span class="regular">•</span> Change does not occur in the total number of marbles in the jar.
			</p>
			<p>
				Normally, you can't have changing the amount of marbles in the jar be the same thing as not changing the amount of marbles in the jar. Those are two possible manifestations of a binary, they are naturally exclusive. But <span class="bold">at the extremes, that definition is irrelevant</span>. Verbs are the reason why you can have plays on words like this. How? Because <a href="Alan-Watts.html" target="blank" class="bold">reality is not dependent on verbage</a> like <span class="content">'change occurring'</span>. Since <span class="italic content">'changing nothing'</span> and <span class="italic content">'no changing'</span> are the same idea, the verb is just a <a href="Unlearning-Contrives.html" target="blank">contrive</a> – <span class="bold">you don't need it to communicate the meaning</span>. By <a href="Reasoning-at-the-Extremes.html" target="blank" class="bold">reasoning at the extremes</a>, we have realized that verbs are just fluff. And, ofcourse, the fact that nothingness can remain constant with the addition of nothing, but that it can also change by nothing, is equivalency. Anyhow, what defines equality? A difference of zero! A change/difference of the amount 'nothing' is just equality. And in the same way, <a href="Zero-Equals-Infinitesimality.html" target="blank" class="bold">an infinitesimal difference is none at all</a>.
