		<h1>Bouncing when Rolling</h1>
		<div class="text">
			<p>
				Take for example this mundane thought experiment. It can also be done physically if you want!
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="content">Drop a ping pong ball and count its bouncing rate per second until it rolls.</span> That's when it has transcended the definition of <span class="content">bouncing</span>!
			</p>
			<p>
				One would argue that you can't count its bounces when its not bouncing. But if bouncing was a philosophically sound idea, it would have to apply universally. This is because <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">discretion is a contrived way to understand the universe</a>; only a holistic approach is philosophically precise.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is the <span class="content">rate of bouncing of the ping pong ball once it rolls</span>? What you find is that it's fair to decide any of the following:
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				<span class="regular">•</span> the ball is not bouncing per each unit of time (<span class="content">0</span>)
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				<span class="regular">•</span> a roll is a single bounce (<span class="content">1</span>) per each instant (if this is your unit of time) such that the ball has no time to really bounce since instants don't last
			</p>
			<p class="tabbed">
				<span class="regular">•</span> the ball is bouncing at an infinite rate (per whatever unit of time) since there is only an instant between each bounce (<span class="content">∞</span>)
			</p>
			<p>
				These explanations are philosophically <span class="bold">equivalent</span> simply because they're each as fair as one another. You can't say that one is correct, and another isn't. Fundamentally, this is because the meaning behind each of the indiscrete numbers' symbols is equivalent.
			</p>
			<p>
				This isn't to imply that this set of explanations is perfectly philosophically precise; rather, it exposes the contrivance of <span class="content">bouncing</span> by demonstrating its eventual ambiguity. It gets us closer to a purely philosophical understanding. The set of explanations is still contrived to the extent that it is expressed using an inherently <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">discrete</a> language; the <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">contrive of discretion</a> remains, for <a href="Unlearning-Contrives.html" target="blank">it is necessary to use lesser contrives to unlearn greater ones</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				These explanations are somewhat more real than other more discrete explanations you would have to describe nonextreme cases. Saying <span class="content">the ping pong ball is bouncing at a rate of 100 bounces per minute</span> is inherently more discrete and approximate than describing <span class="content">the ping pong ball to be bouncing infinitely when rolling</span>. This is because the description of infinity is absolute, nonrelative, meaning it can't be approximate and discrete since relativity is necessary for discretion and absoluteness is inherently not approximating.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a main insight of the equivalencies, the realization that ideas such as language contrive our understanding of reality. While useful in speech, pointing out <span class="content">a ball's bounces</span> is not philosophically precise. Only something else, like recognition of <a href="The-Fractal-Wave-Universe.html" target="blank">a waveform, continuously part of a greater fractal wave of the universe</a>, would be continuous with reality and thus philosophically precise.
