		<h1>Unlearning Contrives</h1>
		<p class="text-centered content">
			"Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them."<span class="italic regular"><br>~ Einstein</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			What Einstein means by that quote is that one must think metacognitively, perhaps by <a href="Reasoning-at-the-Extremes.html" target="blank">reasoning at the extremes</a>, when resolving a problem. This applies whether the problem is a missing link in physics or a philosophical confusion. A similar colloquial phrase would be <span class="content">"Think outside the box."</span>. Fundamentally, the point is just that you have to change your mindset instead of again following along the same reasoning that lead you to the problem in the first place. You have to unlearn what you have learned, for the problem exists only in your mind.

		<p>
			In order to unlearn, it's important to <a href="http://simplifience.com/intro/contrives.html" target="blank">understand what a 'contrive' is</a>, because that's what you should be unlearning. Through unlearning contrives, <a href="http://simplifience.com/intro/philosophy.html" target="blank">you will find everything to be much simpler</a>. For example, in calculus one day I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity" target="blank">Euler's identity (that <span class="content">e<span class="superscript">Ï€i</span> = -1</span>)</a>... I had no idea why at first (and my teacher claimed it was way too above me to be explained), but through <a href="http://simplifience.com/sample/identity.html" target="blank">an uncontrived understanding</a>, it was wonderfully simple! <a href="simplifience.com/foundations/mathematics.html" target="blank">Mathematics should really be more intuitive, and less archaic.</a> The simpler any understanding is, the less <a href="The-Universe-is-Indiscrete.html" target="blank">discrete</a> and approximate it will naturally be, and thus the more philosophically precise!
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that unlearning contrives requires the use of lesser contrives. For example, unlearning the idea of <span class="content"><a href="Bouncing-when-Rolling.html" target="blank">bouncing</a></span> requires the imagination of discretion to remain, otherwise one would not be able to follow the reasoning, as it employs an inherently discrete language.
